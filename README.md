# Thurston Geometry
Cosmological calculations in Thurston Geometries to support the calculations found in
> *Cosmologial constraints on anisotropic Thurston geometries*, Smith, A., Copi, C.J., Starkman, G. (2024).

Provided is a Mathematica notebook for performing the calculations and a Jupyter notebook for calculating the limits and making the plots.

The notebooks will be made available soon.
